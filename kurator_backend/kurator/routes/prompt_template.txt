# Example 1
Consider the following git diff:

```

  kind: RabbitmqCluster
  metadata:

Format note: The lines beginning with `-` have been deleted, and the lines beginning with `+` have been added. Other lines were not changed.

Here's an English description of the changes being made in this diff:

```
- The Anti-affinity constraint is now removed from the config.
- The cluster is now configured to use 50Gi of persistence storage
- The number of replicas is being increased from 2 to 3

No other changes have been made.
```

In imperative form:

```
- Remove the Anti-affinity constraint from the config.
- Configure the cluster to use 50Gi of persistence storage
- Increase the number of replicas from 2 to 3
```
